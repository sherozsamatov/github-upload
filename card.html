            Jaguars are the largest of South America's big cats. They once roamed
            from the southern tip of that continent north to the region
            surrounding the U.S.-Mexico border. Today significant numbers of
            jaguars are found only in remote regions of South and Central
            America—particularly in the Amazon Basin.

            These beautiful and powerful beasts were prominent in ancient Native
            American cultures. In some traditions the Jaguar God of the Night was
            the formidable lord of the underworld. The name jaguar is derived from
            the Native American word yaguar, which means “he who kills with one
            leap.”
