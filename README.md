# Project Jaguar
This is one of the first projects of mine that I did a while ago, but it was sitting on my computer, but as part of a "Github Upload" course I decided to upload it onto GitHub. The code will be modified to improve the look of the page.

This project is one of the exercises that I completed as part of a full-stack course on Udacity
