# Project Jaguar
This is one of the first projects of mine that I did a while ago and was sitting on my computer, so I decided to upload it onto GitHub as an exercise of a "Github Upload" course. The code will be modified to improve the look of the page.

This project is one of the exercises that I completed as part of a full-stack course on Udacity
